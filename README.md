UML Reverse Mapper
===========================

Automatically generate [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) based class diagram from your code.

Using reflection, UML Reverse Mapper scans your packages that contain your code. It then builds a graph of class relations and creates a Graphviz .dot file from that.
